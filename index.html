<h1 style="text-align:center; font-family: Arial;">Welcome To My First Website! &#128075;</h1>
<h5 style="text-align:center; font-family: Arial; margin-top: 0px;">aiishwinmuraliy.com</h5>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: Arial;">This is a project I just started! Learning to code HTML by myself. Let's play around! </p>

<h2 style="text-align:center; font-family: Arial; ">About Me</h2>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: Arial;">I am a 15 year old, attending Waterloo University majoring in computer science, currently doing an internship for Amazon. Ok. I'm just joking.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: Arial;">I'm actually a 15 year old who wished to be doing the things above in the future. I'm just dipping my feet in HTML. I also know Python, and not only is that the language  I'm the most fluent in, but it is the only other language I know.</p>
<p style="text-align:center; font-family: Arial;">I am born and raised in Mississauga, Ontario and am currently attending St. Marcellinus Secondary School. Wondering what I look like? Well, below is a huge visual!</p>

<h2 style="text-align:left; font-family: Arial;">My Programming Journey</h2>
<!-- In this paragraph I changed the background and the color of the text. -->
<p style="background-color: darkgray; color:white; font-family: Arial;">
I started programming for the first time in my life 2 years ago. I had started at a place named STEM1 in Mississauga, Ontario. However, when I first started to attend STEM1 I didn't start with actually writing code. I started with a block style coding acitivity called "Dash n' Dot". It was essentially something that introduced children into the world of coding and creating algorithims. Although I wasn't nesseccarily coding, I was getting introducing myself to filling in variables and understanding the ulitmate format of coding.
Having a little bit of a robotics background I was able to understand the meaning behind all these block codes and found that concept a little too easy for my 'enjoyment'. I was later introduced to the wonderul world of Python! I had always heard about Python, but I just was never shown was it actually was and how it worked. A new guy named Eric had just started working at the center and so he was our so called "Python Instuctor". It was from him where I had learned all the basics of Python and had intrduced to me the method of actually writing code.
It was pretty cool. I learnt the absolute basics of programming which gave me the knowledge to understand how to learn other languages, like HTML, by myself. And now I'm here, a begineer-intermediate coder who loves the concept of 'engeneering' things on his laptop and making cool projects. Let's see where this road takes us.

<h2>My Interests</h2>
<p style="font-family: Arial;">
I like to describe my interests as phases. I have had certain phases where I am totally submereged in this one topic and can't let go of it. How do I know when I'm in one of these so called phases? Well I identify them based on my YouTube reccommeneded. The easisest way to indentify my 'phase' is to to take a look at my YouTube recommended page. Right now I'm in my "coding phase"! You'll see a bunch a videos about coding; "How I got into Google", "Google Mock-Interview Questions", "Top Languages to learn in 2021" - those type of things. I've had a bunch of phases. I had a fishing phase, where I was crazy about fishing and all the equipment and how to become a pro. Fun fact; I've never actually caught a fish! I had a DJing phase, which I'm still partially in right now, haven't let go of that one yet!
I had a building/woodworking phase. It was when I had come back from the cottage where I had built a bench and was totally obsessed with power tools and building stuff. I've had a bunch of these phases, and in each one I've learnt a bunch of stuff. I don't really forget any of that information that I learn from my interests, I've just gained a bunch of knowlegde on them. Thanks to this day and age with resources like YouTube and Google, I'm able to learn about whatever I want to basically become a knowledge guru about the topic. So to conclude this segment; I have a lot of interests, too many to count, and I'm interest-ed in them all!
